## The difference between text editor and IDEs
The main different is we have a compiler, or a debugger in IDEs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I learned how to write a command line like
1. echo which is a command to write a message on file
2. ls I need it to display content in my directory
3. pwd (print working directory) to make verify you are in your directory
4. cd we need it to go to another directory
## Things about files
we have many extension of files, such as:
- **file.exe** like a program.
- **file.txt**  a plain text file.
- **file.png, file.gif, file.jpg** an image.

Also, I learned how I can make directory name with space, we can use: 
- *Quotes* 'directory name'
- *backslash* directory\name

we can hide files by ls -a
## finally we install Ubuntu
