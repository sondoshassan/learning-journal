# chapter 8
- DOCType 
To tell a browser which version of Html you use
the command in Html5: `<!DOCType html>`
- `<!--        -->`
this is for comment
- id and class attribute
id to identify an element to other elements on a page.
class to identify an element in a document
you put the attributes in the tag.
example of this:
1. `<li id="your text">      </li>`
2. `<ul class="your text">     </ul>`
- inline elment 
which is on the same line, like:
`<b> **to make text bold** </b>`
`<em> *to make text italic* </em>`
- grouping text and elements
1. `<div>`
we use it to goupe the text or elements in ablock, so it makes easy to follow the code.
2. `<span>`
it's like div but it's inline, but we can use it to control the apperance of text in these element in CSS.
- `<iframe>`
to cut the window and put it on your page.
`<iframe
src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york
&amp;output=embed"
width="450"
height="350"
frameborder="0"
scrolling="no">
</iframe>`
note: scrolling and frameborder will not be supported in Html5.
- `<meta>`
contains information about your web page, it doesn't have a close tag but it has an attribute. we write it in <head>.
