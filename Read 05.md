# CSS 
to make style for your web by writing the style in an external sheet, and then
link it by using `<<link rel=" stylesheet" href="css/style.css">` in HTML.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
we have many ways to use color property, I will mention three of this:
1. rgb values
color: rgb(red,green,blu);
2. hex codes
`color: #ffffff;`
3. color names
`color: white;`
- you can also color background by:
`background-color: white;`
- you can control the opacity by:
`opacity: 0.5;`   *the number is between 0 to 1*
- rgba property 
you need to use it for specification a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but
adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
`background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);` the final number will be between 0 and 1
- we can use also hsl which is mean Hue, saturation, and lightness.
`background-color: hsla(0,0,0,0.5);`
`background-color: hsl(0,0,0,0.5);`
