## Comparison operators
to compare the value in script. the result of this will be boolean.
1. equal ==
2. not equal !=
3. strict equal === to check the value and data type is equal
4. strict not equal !== check if the data and value is the same return false
5. greater than > 
6. less than <
7. greater than or equal
8. less than or equal
## logical operator
**logical operator to compare the results of more than one comparison operator**
1. && and
2. || or
3. ! not

## for loop
I use it to repeat an operation for specific number of times.
`for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){ document.write (i) }`
this intialization var i = 0;
condition is i<0;
update is i++
when the condition becomes false the code block will stop.
## while
`var i; while (i<10) {document.write (i); i++;}`
the while doing the command at least one time.
