# How computer works?
1. What make a computer, computer?
it takes `input` (this all things do in a computer like a record video and press on the keyboard), these inputs give
computer information, which stores in the `storage` then `processing` takes the information from storage
and process it by the algorithm and then the information back to store in storage, now the information
ready to be `output` (games, photo, video, signals to control robot).
- fact the earliest computers were made from wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears.

2. Binary and Data
by using the binary system (1 and 0). a number of bit means a number of wires.
all things will be represented in a binary system like images, video, text and all.
- images in binary 
every image have each pixel, every pixel have a color which is rgp and it be represented by a number.
- sound in binary
have a series of vibration, vibration is represented in a waveform, each point in waveform represented by a number.
 3. Circuits and Logic
 - not circuit
 make 0 to 1
 - and circuit
 if i have to ones it will give me 1 otherwise 0
 - or circuit
 **by adding together these circuits we will do all logic operations.**
 adder = xor + and
 4. CPU, Memory, Input & Output
 CPU: central processing unit
 the cpu convert what I do in computers to a binary system and then store it.
 5. Hardware and Software
 hardware every thing you can see it like chip, circuit, wires and many things.
 software something can't see it like apps, web, game and many things.
